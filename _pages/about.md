Hi there! I'm Megan.

I am currently a research assistant for Professor Jeffrey Liebman at the Taubman Center in the Harvard Kennedy School. I graduated from Harvard in 2023, and I studied economics and computer science. I will be joining the Walmart Economics team in July 2024 to continue my pre-doc. 

I am a proud Midwesterner, born and raised near Cincinnati, OH. Before this, I worked in non-profit fundraising, program development, and product management.

In my free time, I [daydream about tech education for kids](https://executebig.org), quadruple the amount of garlic needed in any given recipe, and make clothes.

<!-- My research interests are broadly labor, public, and urban economics.  -->
